Description
My motivation for the project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using these 3 I was able to create a website based on content to study. This webpage will help in the future when I need to find information that will help me, and I will also keep updating the websie as my skills progress. I will no longer have multiple pages open whether in a physical notebook or word documents, it is an easy to navigate webpage with everything on it. By creating this webpage I have learned the basics of web development. I also learned how to navigate git hub and apply changes to a project via a branch. This will help when working with multiple people other than myself. Before creating this webpage I did not know much about coding, but now I have a good start for beginning the course.
