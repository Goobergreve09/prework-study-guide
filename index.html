        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li><b>HTML</b> is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An <b>element</b> is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li><b>Elements</b> are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular <b>!DOCTYPE</b> htm declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li><b>!DOCTYPE</b> is not case-sensitive because it is a <b>declaration</b>. <b>Declarations</b> are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. </li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b> is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for <b>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b>.</li>
          <li>-	<b>Search engine optimization (SEO)</b> is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
          <li>The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The <b>meta</b> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements.</b> </li>
          <li>The element containing other elements are called <b>parent elements</b></li>
          <li>The relationship between the parent and child elements is referred to as <b>parent/child</b></li>
          <li>In <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as <b>div</b> to create a division in the page, or <b>span</b> to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an <b>opening tag</b> and a <b>closing tag</b>. Ex. head lala land /head</li>
          <li>The <b>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6</b> elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The <b>p</b> element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The <b>ul, ol, and li</b> elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
          <li>The <b>img</b> element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the <b>src</b> attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The <b>br</b> element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
          <li>The <b>a</b> element <b>(which stands for anchor)</b> creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,h1, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li><b>section</b> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.></li>
        </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>We use <b>CSS</b> to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: <b>inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</b></li>
       <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use <b>inline CSS.</b> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a <b>style</b> attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
       <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a <b>style</b> element in the <b>head</b> element. 
       <li>This <b>internal style sheet</b> contains <b>CSS rules</b> for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, <b>a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</b></li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an <b>external CSS style sheet</b>.</li>
       <li>This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
       <li>When using an external style sheet, we <b>link</b> the file using a link element placed in the HTML's <b>head</b></li>
       <li>A <b>selector</b> defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
       <li><b>Declarations</b> contain two important components: <b>the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</b>. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
       <li>The <b>margin</b> is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
       <li>A <b>margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A <b>padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
       <li>When you increase <b>padding</b>, you are actually making the entire element bigger! <b>That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</b></li>
       <li><b>DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY)</b> is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. <b>DRY</b> can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
       <li> <b>text-align: center;.</b> This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
       <li>The <b>block</b> value assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
       <li>The <b>img selector</b> assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
       <li>The <b>rel</b> attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
       <li>The <b>href</b> attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path.</li>
       <li>The period preceding <b>card</b> designates this as a <b>class</b> selector. Any HTML element assigned to the <b>class card</b>, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
       <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. <b>We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</b></li>
