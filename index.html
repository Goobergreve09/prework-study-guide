        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li><b>HTML</b> is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An <b>element</b> is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li><b>Elements</b> are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers</li>
          <li>This <b>declaration</b> tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular !DOCTYPE htm> declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li><b>!DOCTYPE</b> is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The <b>body element</b> contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. </li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b> is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular <b>!DOCTYPE</b> htm declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>

          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for <b>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b>.</li>
          <li>-	<b>Search engine optimization (SEO)</b> is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
          <li>The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The <b>meta</b> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements.</b> </li>
          <li>The element containing other elements are called <b>parent elements</b></li>
          <li>The relationship between the parent and child elements is referred to as parent/child</li>
          <li>In <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>

          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an <b>opening tag</b> and a <b>closing tag</b>. Ex. head lala land /head</li>
          <li>The <b>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6</b> elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The <b>p</b> element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The <b>ul, ol, and li</b> elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
          <li>The <b>img</b> element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The <b>br</b> element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
          <li>The <b>a</b> element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,h1, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li><b>Section</b> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.></li>
          <li>The <b>img</b> element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the <b>src</b> attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>

      <li>The <b>a</b> element <b>(which stands for anchor)</b> creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
       <li>We use <b>CSS</b> to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
       <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: <b>inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</b></li>
       <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use <b>inline CSS.</b> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a <b>style</b> attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
       <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a <b>style</b> element in the <b>head</b> element. 
       <li>This <b>internal style sheet</b> contains <b>CSS rules</b> for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, <b>a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</b></li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an <b>external CSS style sheet</b>.</li>
       <li>This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
       <li>When using an external style sheet, we <b>link</b> the file using a link element placed in the HTML's <b>head</b></li>
       <li>A <b>selector</b> defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
       <li><b>Declarations</b> contain two important components: <b>the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</b>. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
       <li>The <b>margin</b> is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
       <li>A <b>margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A <b>padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
       <li>When you increase <b>padding</b>, you are actually making the entire element bigger! <b>That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</b></li>
       <li><b>DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY)</b> is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. <b>DRY</b> can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
       <li> <b>text-align: center;.</b> This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
       <li>The <b>block</b> value assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
       <li>The <b>img selector</b> assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
       <li>The <b>rel</b> attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
       <li>The <b>href</b> attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path.</li>
       <li>The period preceding <b>card</b> designates this as a <b>class</b> selector. Any HTML element assigned to the <b>class card</b>, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
       <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. <b>We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</b></li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Github</b> is the web interface for <b>Git</b>, a version control software that allows multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time without getting in each other’s way. </li>
          <li>Every project in <b>Github</b> is called a <b>repository</b>. It contains all of the project files and revision history.</li>
          <li><b>Repositories</b> can be owned by one developer or shared by a team or organization. <b>Repositories</b> also have the added benefit of making collaboration between developers much easier.</li>
          <li>A <b>branch</b> is a workspace where you make changes that doesn’t effect the live state. Create a new <b>branch</b> for your work – and name it in  way that best describes your work.</li>
          <li><b>Markdown (.md)</b> are the way content files are formatted in Github. It’s a way to write for the web using plain text; easily converts to HTML. <b>Markdown files use .md.</b></li>
          <li><b>Commit Changes</b> means Saving a new version of the file you’re working on. <b>Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file you’re making a commit.</b> This will add changes to your branch.</li>
          <li><b>Pull Request (“PR”)</b> means asking for changes in a branch to merge into another branch. It’s a way to discuss and review our work with others.</li>
          <li>A <b>Merge</b> is when a PR is approved, changes are <b>“pulled in”, or merged into a main branch.</b> Changes publish/deploy to the live site when this happens.</li>
          <li>An <b>Issue</b> is a way to report new tasks or content fixes. It can track progress on a project board, and open a new issue for a task and close once done. </li>
          <li>During development, you may hear the term <b>blocker</b>, which is just another way of saying that you are stuck on a particular problem that is preventing you from moving forward</li>
          <li>Another term you may see is <b>bottleneck</b>, which refers to a point in our development process that is slowing down the rest of production.</li>
          <li><b>GitHub issues</b> are often formatted with a language called <b>Markdown</b>. Issues usually include a title and a description that has user stories and acceptance criteria to describe the task that needs to be completed.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>JavaScript (JS)</b> is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using <b>JavaScript</b>, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>In web development, <b>JavaScript</b> is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
          <li><b>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</b> built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li><b>Third-party APIs</b> that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
          <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
          <li><b>Variables</b> are containers that store values. <b>You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</b></li>
          <li><b>Variables</b> are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. </li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the <b>var</b> keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>A <b>semicolon</b> at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. <b>It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line</b></li>
          <li><b>JavaScript is case sensitive.</b> This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</li>
          <li><b>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value</b> - this can be done on the same line as the declaration -<b>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name.</b></li>
          <li>In any computer programming language, a <b>string</b> is a sequence of characters used to represent text.</li>
          <li>To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>In computer science, a <b>Boolean</b> is a logical data type that can have only the values <b>true or false.</b></li>
          <li> The words <b>true and false</b> are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object depending upon the language).</li>
          <li> <b>Arrays</b> are used to store multiple values under a single variable name. A regular variable, on the other hand, can store only one value.</li>
          <li><b>The first statement of an array determines the starting point for our loop.</b></li>
          <li><b>The second statement of an array is the condition.</b></li>
          <li><b>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</b></li>
          <li>To create an <b>array</b>, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, <b>instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.</b></li>
          <li>A <b>for</b> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>In order to use the for loop, we need the variables <b>index and the array's length.</b></li>
          <li>This location of a data item in an <b>array</b> is identified with a unique number called an <b>index</b>. Using each piece of <b>data's index, or location number</b>, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>Each item in an <b>array</b> has a number attached to it, called a <b>numeric index</b>, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, <b>arrays start at index zero</b> and can be manipulated with various methods.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, <b>objects</b> can be seen as a collection of properties</li>
          <li><b>Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</b></li>
          <li><b>Comments</b> are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.</li>
          <li>An <b>operator</b> is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li><b>Conditionals</b> are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the <b>if...else statement.</b></li>
          <li><b>Functions</b> are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.></li>
          <li>A <b>function</b>is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li><b>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function.</b></li>
          <li>To <b>execute</b> a function, we must call it in our code. </li>
          <li><b>Arguments</b> go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
          <li>We can use the <b>console.log</b> method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>the <b>alert()</b> function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</li>
          <li>The <b>return</b> statement tells the browser to return the <b>result</b> variable out of the function so it is available to use.</li>
          <li>All types except Object define <b>immutable</b> values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values.</li>
          <li>An <b>immutable</b> value is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value.</li>
          <li>The <b>null</b> value represents the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
          <li>The <b>typeof</b> operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value.</li>
          <li><b>Undefined</b> is a <b>primitive</b> value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.</li>
          <li>All <b>primitive types</b>, except <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b>, have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values.</li>
          <li>Conceptually, <b>undefined</b> indicates the absence of a value, while <b>null</b> indicates the absence of an object</li>
          <li>The <b>BigInt</b> type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
          <li>A <b>Symbol</b> is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of <b>properties.</b></li>
          <li>There are two types of object properties: <b>The data property</b> and the <b>accessor property.</b></li>
          <li><b>Data properties</b> associate a key with a value.</li>
          <li><b>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</b> is a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages.</li>
          <li>The <b>primitive coercion</b> process is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be.</li>
          <li><b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li><b>Control flow</b> can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li> An <b>if</b> statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li><b>Math.floor() and Math.random()</b> are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
